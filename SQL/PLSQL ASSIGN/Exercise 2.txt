			Exercise 2   
1. Select from any table a number and determine whether it is within a given range (for 
example, between 1 and 10).  


delimiter //
create procedure abc5()
begin
declare x int;
select x into x from customers where x=5;
if x >1 and x< 10 then
  insert into tempp values('x is in range');
else
insert into tempp values('x is not in range');
end if;
end; //
delimiter ;


2. Select from any table three positive integers representing the sides of a triangle, and 
determine whether they form a valid triangle. Hint: In a triangle, the sum of any two 
sides must always be greater than the third side. 

delimiter //
create procedure abc8()
begin
declare p int;
declare q int;
declare r int;
select a,b,c into p,q,r from abc where a=7;
if (p+q >r or q+r>p or p+r>q) then 
    insert into tempp values('valid traingle');
else 
insert into tempp values('Invalid traingle');
  end if;
end; //
delimiter ;

4. Write a program that Selects from any table two character strings.  Your program should 
then determine if one character string exists inside another character string.
