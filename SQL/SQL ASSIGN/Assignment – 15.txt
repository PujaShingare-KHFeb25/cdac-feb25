 Using Subqueries with DML Commands.

 1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions 
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one 
customer into this table. 

mysql> create table multicust as select * from salespeople where snum in(select snum from customers group by snum having count(snum)>1);
Query OK, 2 rows affected, 1 warning (0.74 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 1

mysql> select * from multicust;
+------+--------+----------+------+
| Snum | Sname  | City     | Comm |
+------+--------+----------+------+
| 1001 | Peel   | London   | 0.12 |
| 1002 | Serres | San Jose | 0.13 |
+------+--------+----------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)


2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders. 









3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all 
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.


UPDATE salespeople
SET comm=comm*1.20
WHERE snum IN
    (SELECT snum
     FROM orders
     WHERE amt>300);
