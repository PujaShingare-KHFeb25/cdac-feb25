Changing Values through Views. 
1) Which of these views are updateable (will allow DML operations)?  
#1  
  
Create View Dailyorders  
as Select Distinct cnum, snum, onum, odate from Orders;  
#2  

Create View Custotals  
as Select cname, Sum (amt) Sum_Amt from Orders, Customers   
where Orders.cnum=Customers.cnum  
Group by cname; 
#3  
 
Create view Thirdorders  
as Select * from Dailyorders  where 
odate=’1990-10-03’;  
#4
Create view Nullcities   
as Select snum, sname, city  
from Salespeople  
where city is NULL   
OR sname BETWEEN ‘A’ and ‘MZ’;  

mysql> update nullcities set city='pune' where snum=1004;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.41 sec)

2) Create a view of the Salespeople table called Commissions. This view will include 
only the snum and comm fields. Through this view, someone could enter or change 
commissions, but only to values between .10 and .20. 

mysql> create view commisions as select snum,comm from salespeople where comm is null or comm between 0.10 and 0.20;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.24 sec)

mysql> select * from commisions;
+------+------+
| snum | comm |
+------+------+
| 1001 | 0.12 |
| 1002 | 0.13 |
| 1004 | 0.11 |
| 1007 | 0.15 |
| 1003 | 0.10 |
+------+------+





 
3) Some SQL implementations have a built-in constant representing the current date, 
sometimes called “CURDATE” or “SYSDATE”.  The word SYSDATE can 
therefore be used in a SQL statement, and be replaced by the current date when the 
value is accessed by commands such as Select or Insert. We will use a view of the 
Orders table called Entryorders to insert rows into the Orders table. Create the 
Orders table, so that SYSDATE is automatically inserted for odate if no value is 
given. Then create the Entryorders view so that no values can be given.
